If you got this from SVN and not a source tarball, you are missing files.

You can generate them using setup.py:

python setup.py compile_resource compile_ui

Those commands require a working PyQt 4.4 (at least) developing environment.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, use a package instead of SVN ;-)
