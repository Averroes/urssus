Introduction
------------

What is uRSSus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

uRSSus is an application for reading online news and blogs.

Usually, online news sites and blogs will offer what is called a :keyword:`feed` 
of their contents. What uRSSus does is fetch those feeds, and tell you if there is
something you haven't seen yet, saving you the work of checking your collection 
of favourite sites.

uRSSus supports all the commonly used Internet standards about feeds. For example, 
it supports Atom and RSS feeds. The goal is that you shouldn't need to care what 
those are: as long as the site has some sort of feed, uRSSus should handle it.

Feeds
-----

How do you know if a site has a feed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It probably has a feed icon somewhere.

   The "feed icon"

In most modern browsers, you should see a feed icon in the location bar 
next to the URL:

.. figure:: h_feedicon1.png

   A site with an available feed in the location bar.

There is a chance you will see it in the web page itself, too:

   A site with an available feed in the web page itself.

Adding a Site's Feed to uRSSus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most web browsers (Firefox, Konqueror), you simply need to click on one 
of the feed icons, and then it will show up in uRSSus.

   Clicking on the RSS icon adds the feed to uRSSus
   
When you add a feed, you are shown its `feed properties dialog`_ where you can 
adjust things like how often it should be checked and more.

Feel free now to add as many feeds as you want. Urssus won't let you subscribe 
to the same feed twice.

Removing a Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a feed from uRSSus, right-click on the feed and select "Delete Feed".

Folders
-------

Organizing Your Feeds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your feed collection grows a bit, having it all in the "All Feeds" folder 
starts becoming impractical. When that happens, you can create your own folders
and organize your feeds.

To create a new folder, right-click on where you want it, and select "Add Folder"
from the context menu.

Keep in mind that only folders can contain other folders, and regular feeds can not.

So, if you select "Add Folder" in a feed's context menu, it will be added as a 
"sibling" of that feed.

In future versions, uRSSus will support "tags" and alternative ways to organize
your feeds.

To change the folder of a feed, just drag it to the folder where you want it.

Super Feeds!
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another thing a folder does is work as a sort of "super feed", which is a 
grouping of all the feeds and subfolders it contains.

That way, if you put all your sport related feeds in a "Sports" folder, you only
need to click on that folder to read them all at once!
