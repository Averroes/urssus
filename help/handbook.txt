Introduction

What is uRSSus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

uRSSus is an application for reading online news and blogs.

Usually, online news sites and blogs will offer what is called a :keyword:`feed` 
of their contents. What uRSSus does is fetch those feeds, and tell you if there is
something you haven't seen yet, saving you the work of checking your collection 
of favourite sites.

uRSSus supports all the commonly used Internet standards about feeds. For example, 
it supports Atom and RSS feeds. The goal is that you shouldn't need to care what 
those are: as long as the site has some sort of feed, uRSSus should handle it.

How do you know if a site has a feed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It probably has a feed icon somewhere.

   The "feed icon"

In most modern browsers, you should see a feed icon in the location bar 
next to the URL:

.. figure:: h_feedicon1.png

   A site with an available feed in the location bar.

There is a chance you will see it in the web page itself, too:

   A site with an available feed in the web page itself.

Adding a Site's Feed to uRSSus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most web browsers (Firefox, Konqueror), you simply need to click on one 
of the feed icons, and then it will show up in uRSSus.

   Clicking on the RSS icon adds the feed to uRSSus
